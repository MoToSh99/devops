    ~ What is MiniTwit?

      A SQLite and Gorilla powered twitter clone written in Golang

    ~ How do I use it?
    
      Use the Makefile to build and run the solution. Hence:
      
      make build && make start

      When up and running, the application will greet
      you on http://localhost:5000/
	
    ~ Is it tested?

      At the moment the solution is only tested manually. 
      Hence no automated testing.
